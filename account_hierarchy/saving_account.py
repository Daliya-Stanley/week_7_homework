# Inheritance: SavingAccount extends Account, meaning it inherits its methods and attributes.
# Encapsulation: The annual interest rate is stored as a private attribute (__fd_annual_interest_rate).
# Getter & Setter Methods: These allow controlled access to the private annual interest rate.
# Interest Calculation: add_fd_annual_interest() calculates how much interest would be earned over a year if the balance remains unchanged.git
